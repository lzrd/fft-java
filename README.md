fft-java
========

This is a port to Java of an original Fft routine in C by Steve Sampson that I did long ago.

I refactored it to be useful for continuous FFT calculations.

It has been cited or used by other projects but has disappeared from my home server a couple of times, so I'm putting it up on github to make it a more durable reference.

Originally hosted at gamelan.com, then [pressurewave.com](http://presssurewave.com/~stoltz/Fft.html) when [gamelan.com](http://web.archive.org/web/19990208004428/http://gamelan.com/) went away.

Ported from public domain source and it remains public domain.
