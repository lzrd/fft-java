fft-java
========

This is a port of an Fft routine I did long ago.

I ported it to Java and refactored it to be useful for continuous FFT
calculations.

It has been cited and used for a couple of academic works but has disappeared from my home server a couple of times, so I'm putting it up on github to make it a more durable reference.

Originally hosted at gamelan.com, then http://presssurewave.com/~stoltz/Fft.html when gamelan.com went away.

Ported from public domain source and it remains public domain.
